## Wallets

Full Example

- React Native CLI Wallet (0.68.5) `wallets/rn_cli_wallet_068_5`

Skeleton Example (WIP)

- React Native CLI Wallet `wallets/rn_cli_wallet`
- React Native Expo Wallet `wallets/rn_expo_wallet`

## Dapps

- Dapp V2 Explorer: `dapps/v2Explorer` or by checking out the alpha SDK [here](https://github.com/WalletConnect/web3modal-react-native)

## Getting Started

- Ensure your[ React Native environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/environment-setup) has been properly setup (XCode, ruby etc). Note for Mac users to have the correct Ruby versions if doing a fresh install.
- Read through our [React Native guide](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/reactnative/overview)
- Check the respective `/wallet` folder to see the `rn_cli_wallet` or `rn_expo_wallet` repo
- Read through the various README files for further information
- Submit any issues / feature requests.

Note:
If you are switching between these wallets (i.e. `rn_cli_068_5` & `rn_cli_070_6`), it is recommended to clear caches using the following command:

```
watchman watch-del-all && rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn cache clean && yarn install && yarn start -- --reset-cache
```

If you run into issues with the simulator version:

```
npx react-native run-ios
error No simulator available with name "iPhone 13".
```

Change the flag with:

```
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
```

# WalletKit / WalletConnect v2 Integration (React Native)

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install @walletconnect/ethereum-provider @walletconnect/web3wallet ethers


If you have `/ios` or Pod Issues, delete the `Podfile.lock` and re-run `pod update && pod install` worked for my case
